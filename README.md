## Git vs. GitHub
* Both Git and Github are used to save code in order to get help, use it as a reference, debug, etc.
* The least complicated way to think of github is to think of it as a cloud. Githib is an easier way to access your code/data, it's an alternative to using a flash drive. It has the same concept as a flash drive, pulling or cloning to your local repository.
* Github is very useful because it opens a repository with version control, prevents crashes, and is open source(optional) so people can branch off your code or help with problems that you may have.
