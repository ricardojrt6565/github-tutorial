## Git vs. GitHub
* Both Git and Github are used to save code in order to get help, use it as a reference, debug, etc.
* The least complicated way to think of github is to think of it as a cloud. Githib is an easier way to access your code/data, it's an alternative to using a flash drive. It has the same concept as a flash drive, pulling or cloning to your local repository.
* Github is very useful because it opens a repository with version control, prevents crashes, and is open source(optional) so people can branch off your code or help with problems that you may have.

## Initial Setup

## Repository Setup
* **After you have setup github**
 * Follow these steps to start your very own repo!  
1.`git init`; in the terminal, what this does is setup your repo with something fancy called _version control_, what version control does is to try to avoid crashes within the project, which is why github is very important. But now that you have a repo, how do you use it?  
2.`git add`; so github is for any kind of coder, so what ever line of code you used you can put up in the stage, think of this process like taking a photograph, you are adding people, removing them, and finally commiting them or how github calls it **snap it**.  
3.`git commit -m""`; So why do you snap it
