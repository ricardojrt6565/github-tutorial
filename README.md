## Git vs. GitHub
* Both Git and Github are used to save code in order to get help, use it as a reference, debug, etc.

* Git is the actual code while github is the server in which supports git.

* The least complicated way to think of github is to think of it as a cloud. Githib is an easier way to access your code/data, it's an alternative to using a flash drive. It has the same concept as a flash drive, pulling or cloning to your local repository.

* Github is very useful because it opens a repository with version control, prevents crashes, and is open source(optional) so people can branch off your code or help with problems that you may have.

## Initial Setup
Create a [github](https://github.com/) account.

1. Make a repository in the website (Should be similar to the depository name,regardless of website or application using).

2. Inside of the terminal type **`git init`** which initializes git inside of the program.

## Repository Setup

**After you have setup github:**

 _Follow these steps to start your very own repo!_  

1. **`git init`**; in the terminal, what this does is setup your repo with something fancy called _version control_, what version control does is to try to avoid crashes within the project, which is why github is very important. But now that you have a repo, how do you use it?  

2. **`git add`**; so github is for any kind of coder, so what ever line of code you used you can put up in the stage, think of this process like taking a photograph, you are adding people, removing them, and finally commiting them.   

3. **`git commit -m""`**; So what this does is basically take a snapshot and sends the data of code into the cloud.

## Workflow & Commands
**So now that you setup...**  

* You have to get used to this flow of work that consists of 3 commands:  
 * `git status`
 * `git add ` 
 * `git commit -m ""`

The importance of all these 3 lines of code are to both keep you aware of your progress and to save your code. You use these 3 lines of code the most because these are what you need the most in order to
