<h2>
<a id="git-vs-github" class="anchor" href="#git-vs-github" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git vs. GitHub</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Both Git and Github are used to save code in order to get help, use it as a reference, debug, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Git is the actual code while github is the server in which supports git.</p></li>
<li><p>The least complicated way to think of github is to think of it as a cloud. Githib is an easier way to access your code/data, it's an alternative to using a flash drive. It has the same concept as a flash drive, pulling or cloning to your local repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Github is very useful because it opens a repository with version control, prevents crashes, and is open source(optional) so people can branch off your code or help with problems that you may have.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="initial-setup" class="anchor" href="#initial-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Setup</h2>

<p>Create a <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> account.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a repository in the website (Should be similar to the depository name,regardless of website or application using).</p></li>
<li><p>Inside of the terminal type <strong><code>git init</code></strong> which initializes git inside of the program.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ssh -T git@github.com</code> by typing this you are basically setting up a connection between your local remote and github, it should also connect with your repository, in which you can <a href="#clone">clone</a>. You would like to have ssh because if you don't you would have to constantly type username and email with https.</p></li>
<li><p>You are almost done! you should feel very proud of yourself, now type in <code>git config --global user.name “Firstname-Last name”</code> then
<code>git config --global user.email “insert email”</code> so you can get the credit when you create something/save something.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="repository-setup" class="anchor" href="#repository-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repository Setup</h2>

<p><strong>After you have setup github:</strong></p>

<p><em>Follow these steps to start your very own repo!</em>  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>To make a repository just go to the github website and click on new repository and name it after your depository, so you can't get confused and be more organized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>git add</code></strong>; so github is for any kind of coder, so what ever line of code you used you can put up in the stage, think of this process like taking a photograph, you are adding people, removing them, and finally commiting them.   </p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>git commit -m""</code></strong>; So what this does is basically take a snapshot and sends the data of code into the cloud.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="workflow--commands" class="anchor" href="#workflow--commands" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workflow &amp; Commands</h2>

<p><strong>So now that you setup...</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>You have to get used to this flow of work that consists of 3 commands:<br>

<ul>
<li><code>git status</code></li>
<li>
<code>git add</code> </li>
<li><code>git commit -m ""</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The importance of all these 3 lines of code are to both keep you aware of your progress and to save your code. You use these 3 lines of code the most because these are what you need the most in order to be the most productive you can be.</p>

<h2>
<a id="clone" class="anchor" href="#clone" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clone</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cloning is pretty self explanatory like the name, making a clone of the code onto your local repository. </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="forking" class="anchor" href="#forking" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Forking</h2>

<ul>
<li>Forking confused with cloning because it may seem like they have the same concept but they are differet. Forking creates a copy into your github in which you can clone and request a pull. Pulling and pushing is how github gets code/files around, how the community stays open, pulling basically is getting a copy of code or idea and puttinng it into your depository. Pushing is basically applying the commits into the original copy of data.</li>
</ul>

<a id="mistakes" class="anchor" href="#mistakes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mistakes</h1>

<p>So you made a mistake.. tsk tsk tsk..Just kidding. If you are here you probably have initalized git somewhere that is not your workspace. Don't worry.</p>

<ul>
<li>To solve this problem type in <code>rm -rf .git</code> which just gets rid of the git folder.</li>
</ul>
